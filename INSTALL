Hints for easy installation:

Set and export the environment variable CUDA_HOME. In most cases, something like this will do:

export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda/5.0

See the CUDA installation documentation for more details.

Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include CUDA's library directory. In most cases, something like this will do:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/5.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

See the CUDA installation documentation for more details.

Use R to install the source package. For example, if you cloned the git repo:

R CMD build gputools && R CMD INSTALL gputools_0.28.tar.gz

If all else fails, you can edit the file gputools/src/config.mk to suit your particular environment.

Enjoy!
